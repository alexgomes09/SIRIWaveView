## Usage
```
<com.alex.siriwaveview.SiriWaveView
        android:id="@+id/siriWaveView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:waveAmount="4"
        app:waveColor="@android:color/white"
        app:waveFrequency="2.0"
        app:waveHeight="50dp"
        app:waveInitialPhaseOffset="0"
        app:wavePhaseShift="-0.05"
        app:waveVerticalPosition="2" />
```

- waveAmount = number of waves
- waveColor = color of the wave
- waveFrequency = how frequent the waves are
- waveHeight - maximum height of center wave
- waveInitialPhaseOffset - if you would like to start wave in different position than default
- wavePhaseShift = how fast wave would be shifting towards end. 
     - negative value will shift wave to the right
     - position value will shift wave to the left
- waveVerticalPosition = basically where you want to set your wave on the screen. 2 will center the wave vertically on the screen
     - try value from 1 to 4

### public methods
